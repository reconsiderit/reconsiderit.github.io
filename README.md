## Mill's Github pages portfolio

### Introduction

This is a quick portfolio I've put together of my various projects and professional experience. I've done many things across a few different industries and wanted to put it all in one, easily accessable place. 
<br></br>
This has been forked from evanca's quick portfolio, which can be found [here](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio). I am new to building websites and have chosen to build a basic web portfolio to better my understanding of how code and web development works. 

<!-- HTML notes can be put into the page like this. -->

### Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
